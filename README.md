# Crypto

Just a simple program which encrypts files using Caesar and Scytale algorithms.

I am a begginer in C++ so...the code as ugly workarounds and ugly all the way...Just do a pull request and I will approve it. Anything is better than this...I think :)))

and if you do make a pull request, please add comments too so I can learn from it.
